## Why This Exists

AI coding agents are powerful, but they lack the opinionated, battle-tested architectural knowledge that comes from shipping real iOS apps. They'll happily generate a `ViewController` with 2,000 lines, wire up Singletons everywhere, and skip actor isolation entirely.

**iOS Agent Skills** is a collection of 25 self-contained skill documents that teach AI agents (and developers) how to build modular, testable, privacy-first iOS applications using modern Swift patterns. Each skill encodes a specific architectural decision — the kind of thing a senior iOS engineer carries in their head but rarely writes down.

These skills were extracted from building a production iOS app with 10+ Tuist modules, on-device LLM integration (Apple Foundation Models), StoreKit 2 subscriptions, EventKit–CoreData sync, and a fully custom SwiftUI design system. They represent real patterns that survived contact with real users.

## What's Inside

**25 skills** organized across **5 categories**, covering everything from build system configuration to on-device AI safety guardrails.

### 🏗️ [Architecture](skills/architecture/) — 7 skills

The structural backbone of a modular iOS app. These skills define how code is organized, how dependencies flow, how services communicate safely across threads, how errors propagate with full type safety, and how all workflows are orchestrated through a single entry point.

| # | Skill | What You'll Learn |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 01 | [Tuist-Based Modular Architecture](skills/architecture/01-tuist-modular-architecture.md) | How to define a `Project.swift` with Core/Feature module layers, enforce strict dependency boundaries at compile time, eliminate Xcode project merge conflicts, and structure a directory convention that scales to 10+ modules. Includes helper functions for `coreFramework()` and `featureFramework()` with automatic test target generation. |
| 02 | [Protocol-Driven Service Catalog](skills/architecture/02-protocol-driven-service-catalog.md) | A complete service catalog in ~80 lines of Swift — no third-party frameworks. Three-layer architecture: Protocol (module-owned), Blueprint (factory), and Registration (composition root). Thread-safe resolution via `NSLock`, `KeyPath`-based type-safe lookups, shared vs. transient registration, and clean `reset()` for test isolation. |
| 03 | [UI Composer Pattern for Feature Modules](skills/architecture/03-ui-composer-pattern-for-feature-modules.md) | How Feature modules expose a single `UIComposer` that accepts pre-resolved dependencies via constructor injection and produces concrete SwiftUI Views (no `AnyView`). Covers `compose*View()` variations for callbacks, runtime data, and the ViewModel-as-dependency-hub pattern. Eliminates service locator calls from Views entirely. |
| 06 | [Actor-Based Concurrency Patterns](skills/architecture/06-actor-based-concurrency-patterns.md) | When to use `actor` vs `@MainActor` vs `@unchecked Sendable` with `NSLock`. Covers actor-isolated data stores (CoreData), `nonisolated` escape hatches for `AsyncThrowingStream`, actor-to-actor communication chains, `Sendable` value-type domain models, and app lifecycle integration. Prevents data races at compile time. |
| 14 | [Typed Error System with Recovery Actions](skills/architecture/14-error-handling-and-typed-error-system.md) | A `WythnosError` enum where every case maps to a title, message, SF Symbol icon, and `RecoveryAction` — rendered through a reusable `NyxErrorCard` design system component. Includes AI safety classification (`SafetyClassification`), localized refusal responses in English and Turkish, and emergency crisis resource handling. |
| 18 | [Makefile for iOS Project Workflows](skills/architecture/18-makefile-for-ios-project-workflows.md) | A self-documenting Makefile as the single entry point for every project workflow: Tuist lifecycle (`make setup`), multiple launch modes (`make run`, `make free`, `make fresh`, `make dev-mode`), unit and snapshot testing (`make test`, `make snapshots`, per-module `make snapshots-design`), snapshot recording (`make snapshots-record`), simulator management, and log streaming. Covers `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` for agents/CI, `_ensure-workspace` auto-generation, `define` functions for app discovery/launch, and `SIMULATOR=` override for targeting any device. |
| 24 | [SwiftData & Observation Framework Patterns](skills/architecture/24-swiftdata-and-observation-framework-patterns.md) | How to use `@Model`, `@Observable`, `@Query`, and `@ModelActor` in a modular Tuist app. Covers persistent model design with `@Attribute(.unique)` and `@Relationship`, `ModelContainer` in Core modules injected via the catalog, `@ModelActor` for compile-time thread-safe background queries, `SchemaMigrationPlan` for CoreData→SwiftData gradual migration, replacing `ObservableObject`/`@Published` with `@Observable` for fine-grained view updates, and `@Query` for direct database access in SwiftUI views. |

### 🎨 [UI](skills/ui/) — 5 skills

Design system infrastructure, custom navigation, and multi-language support for SwiftUI apps that feel premium.

| # | Skill | What You'll Learn |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 04 | [Design System as Core Module](skills/ui/04-design-system-as-core-module.md) | A four-layer design system: tokens (colors, typography, spacing, corner radii as static enums), reusable components (`NyxCard`, `NyxErrorCard`, `NyxFeedbackToggle`, `AutoSizingTextEditor`, `FlowLayout`), animation components (typed text, count-up numbers, slide-up/breathing-glow modifiers), and a centralized haptic feedback system with pre-initialized generators. Dark-mode-only, 4pt grid, OLED-optimized true black. |
| 13 | [Custom Tab Bar & Navigation](skills/ui/13-swiftui-custom-tab-bar-and-navigation.md) | Replacing `TabView` with a fully custom tab bar using `safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)` (the correct API — not `overlay` or `ZStack`). Covers re-tap detection for scroll-to-top via `.id()` change, spring-physics `ButtonStyle`, breathing glow animations for the active tab glyph, keyboard avoidance with `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)`, splash screen → content transitions, and onboarding → main app flow. |
| 16 | [Localization & Multi-Language Patterns](skills/ui/16-localization-and-multi-language-patterns.md) | Supporting 43 languages in a modular Tuist app where each framework owns its string catalogs via `bundle: .module`. Covers bilingual AI intent classification (English + Turkish keywords), locale-aware gene pools for AI personality, localized safety refusal responses for crisis situations, and test coverage for multi-language keyword detection. |
| 17 | [safeAreaInset Stacking & Bottom-Pinned Views](skills/ui/17-safe-area-inset-stacking-and-bottom-pinned-views.md) | Why nested `safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)` hides inner views behind the outer one. Documents five approaches that **don't work** (VStack below ScrollView, inner `safeAreaInset`, overlay, layoutPriority, toolbar bottomBar) and the root cause: the outer `safeAreaInset` always wins in Z-order. The fix: place all bottom-pinned chrome (tab bar + per-tab input bars) inside a **single** `safeAreaInset` block at the outermost level, with conditional content per tab. |
| 21 | [Accessibility: VoiceOver, Dynamic Type & Reduced Motion](skills/ui/21-accessibility-voiceover-dynamic-type-patterns.md) | Enforcing VoiceOver traversal order with `.accessibilityElement(children:)` and `.accessibilitySortPriority()` for custom tab bars, Dynamic Type scaling with `@ScaledMetric(relativeTo:)` and `.dynamicTypeSize(...)` range clamping, reduced motion fallbacks via `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)`, WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast audit of design tokens, `@Environment(\.accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor)` shape fallbacks, accessibility identifiers with `"module.screen.element"` convention, and `performAccessibilityAudit()` in XCUITests for automated WCAG checking in CI. |

### 🧪 [Testing & Debugging](skills/testing-and-debugging/) — 6 skills

Quality assurance patterns that keep modular apps reliable across CI, simulators, and Xcode Previews.

| # | Skill | What You'll Learn |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 05 | [Swift Testing & TDD Patterns](skills/testing-and-debugging/05-swift-testing-and-tdd-patterns.md) | Modern Swift Testing framework (`@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`) over XCTest for all unit tests. Test isolation via `UserDefaults(suiteName: #function)`, five categories of tests (service logic, catalog, AI engine, sanitizer/filter, actor-based async), stub override via `Catalog.main.supply()`, UI test base class with launch arguments, and regression tests driven by real bug screenshots. |
| 09 | [Debug Modes & Mock Services](skills/testing-and-debugging/09-debug-modes-and-mock-service-strategy.md) | A three-tier mock system: Tier 1 (UI testing — minimal, fixed data), Tier 2 (rich debug — 30 days of realistic calendar patterns with Pro access), and Tier 3 (developer mode — secret gesture activation with SHA256-hashed codes for QA testers without Xcode). Shows how to override `Catalog` registrations via launch arguments (`--uitesting`, `--pro-debug`) and re-supply dependent services for graph consistency. |
| 17 | [Snapshot Testing with swift-snapshot-testing](skills/testing-and-debugging/17-snapshot-testing-with-swift-snapshot-testing.md) | Per-module visual regression testing using Point-Free's swift-snapshot-testing in a Tuist modular app. Covers strategic language selection (5 of 43 locales: en, ar/RTL, de/long words, ja/CJK, tr), device matrix (SE/Pro/Pro Max), `SnapshotTestSupport` static framework with `ENABLE_TESTING_SEARCH_PATHS`, component-level and full-screen assertions, deterministic mock factories, recording vs verification modes, CI pipeline configuration, and precision tolerance for cross-platform rendering. |
| 18 | [UI Testing for Regression & Smoke Testing](skills/testing-and-debugging/18-ui-testing-regression-and-smoke.md) | Comprehensive XCUITest suite for critical user journeys. Covers test base class with launch arguments (`--uitesting`, `--skip-onboarding`), accessibility identifier conventions, tab navigation tests, chat flow (send message, feedback buttons), chat history (open, select session, new chat), settings (name field, privacy links, web views, feedback button), keyboard behavior (show/dismiss, tab switch), CI integration, Makefile targets, and handling flaky tests with `waitForExistence` and predicates. |
| 25 | [Performance Monitoring & Profiling Patterns](skills/testing-and-debugging/25-performance-monitoring-and-profiling-patterns.md) | MetricKit integration for crash/hang metrics and diagnostic payloads, `OSSignposter` for custom interval measurement (LLM inference, calendar sync), launch time profiling in three phases (pre-main, catalog registration, first frame), memory pressure tests with `mach_task_basic_info` for 10K-event sync validation, privacy-aware metric reporting (typed `PerformanceMetric` struct, no PII), and Tuist generation time profiling at scale. |
| 26 | [Structured Logging & Log Levels](skills/testing-and-debugging/26-structured-logging-and-log-levels.md) | Per-module `os.Logger` configuration with subsystem/category organization mirroring Tuist module boundaries, strict log level discipline (debug/info/notice/error/fault decision tree), privacy annotations for PII protection (`privacy: .private`, `.private(mask: .hash)`), log forging prevention for user-controlled strings, `OSLogStore` for in-app log retrieval in debug builds, Console.app and `log` CLI filtering commands, Makefile target integration, and Sendable-safe logging in actors. |

### 📱 [Platform Frameworks](skills/platform-frameworks/) — 8 skills

Patterns for integrating Apple system frameworks (StoreKit, EventKit, WidgetKit, UNUserNotificationCenter) into modular apps, plus App Store publishing and direct distribution pipelines.

| # | Skill | What You'll Learn |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 07 | [StoreKit 2 Subscription System](skills/platform-frameworks/07-storekit2-intelligence-based-trial.md) | An intelligence-based trial that ends when the AI demonstrates value (50 interactions, 3 patterns discovered, or 21 days) — not a fixed free trial. Covers the `TrialManager` actor state machine (trial → grace → expired → subscribed), `DailyQueryTracker` with generous first-week limits (150 queries), StoreKit 2 async purchase/entitlement API, product ID conventions, feature gating, and trial funnel analytics. |
| 10 | [Privacy-First Analytics Architecture](skills/platform-frameworks/10-privacy-first-analytics-architecture.md) | A pluggable multi-backend analytics actor with typed event factory methods (no free-form strings). Covers the privacy filter (what is NEVER sent: calendar titles, locations, notes, user names), `nonisolated` fire-and-forget tracking from any context, buffer + flush for network efficiency, OSLog backend as zero-dependency fallback, and graceful TelemetryDeck configuration via Info.plist. |
| 11 | [Notification Service with Deep Linking](skills/platform-frameworks/11-notification-service-with-deep-linking.md) | An actor-based notification service that schedules LLM-generated local notifications (weekly summaries, meeting reminders, insight milestones). Deep linking to native video call apps (Zoom, Meet, Teams, Webex — 11 platforms) by extracting URLs from event locations and converting to native URL schemes. Covers engagement-gated permission requests, smart meeting importance scoring, and `NotificationPreferences` with `Codable` persistence. |
| 12 | [EventKit–CoreData Sync Architecture](skills/platform-frameworks/12-eventkit-coredata-sync-architecture.md) | A three-layer sync pipeline: `CalendarService` (EventKit abstraction) → `CalendarSyncManager` (orchestrator actor) → `CalendarStore` (CoreData actor). Covers programmatic CoreData model creation (no `.xcdatamodeld` — better for Tuist framework targets), upsert by ID, `NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy`, full sync (90 days back + 7 forward), incremental sync from last sync date, `Sendable` value-type domain models, and `inMemory: true` for fast tests. |
| 15 | [WidgetKit & App Intents Integration](skills/platform-frameworks/15-widgetkit-and-app-intents-integration.md) | Lightweight Home Screen widgets as a separate Tuist target with no framework dependencies. Covers `TimelineProvider` with placeholder/snapshot/timeline, multi-size widget views (`systemSmall` + `systemMedium`), `containerBackground(.black, for: .widget)` (iOS 17+), `AppIntent` for Siri Shortcuts, data sharing via App Groups, and 15-minute refresh cadence for battery efficiency. |
| 20 | [App Store Connect Publishing Pipeline](skills/platform-frameworks/20-fastlane-app-store-connect-publishing.md) | End-to-end publishing pipeline: certificate creation (Development, Distribution, Developer ID), App Store Connect API key auth, fastlane lanes (create_app, build, upload, metadata, release) for iOS and macOS, xcodebuild archive workflows, ExportOptions plist, Developer ID direct distribution with notarization, GitHub Releases, entitlements management, Makefile integration for App Store and direct distribution targets, and a first-time setup script. |
| 22 | [GitHub Actions CI/CD for iOS](skills/platform-frameworks/22-github-actions-ci-cd-for-ios.md) | Complete CI/CD pipeline for Tuist-based iOS apps using GitHub Actions: three workflows (`test.yml` for PR validation, `build.yml` for main branch archives, `release.yml` for tag-triggered App Store submission), Tuist and SPM dependency caching with `actions/cache@v4`, code signing via fastlane match with encrypted certificates in a private git repo, parallel snapshot testing across a 5-locale x 3-device matrix (15 jobs), macOS runner pinning with explicit `xcode-select`, cost optimization via Linux pre-checks, and Makefile target integration for CI/local consistency. |
| 23 | [App Clips & Shared Extensions](skills/platform-frameworks/23-app-clips-and-shared-extensions-modular-architecture.md) | Structuring App Clips, Share Extensions, and Notification Content Extensions as separate Tuist targets with filtered Core module dependencies. Covers App Clip binary size optimization under the 15 MB limit (`-Osize`, dead code stripping, `xcrun appcliputil validate`), App Group data sharing between app/clip/extensions, clip-to-app data migration, `NSUserActivity` invocation URL handling, Share Extension content extraction from `NSExtensionContext`, responder chain URL opening pattern, and Notification Content Extension with shared DesignSystem components. |

### 🤖 [AI & Intelligence](skills/ai-and-intelligence/) — 1 skill

On-device AI architecture for privacy-first, zero-latency inference.

| # | Skill | What You'll Learn |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 08 | [On-Device LLM with Apple Foundation Models](skills/ai-and-intelligence/08-on-device-llm-with-apple-foundation-models.md) | 100% on-device inference using Apple's Foundation Models framework (iOS 26+) — no model download, no API key, no data leaves the device. Covers protocol-first `LLMEngineProtocol`, `LanguageModelSession` for single-shot and streaming responses, a dynamic prompt gene pool system (10 gene types: persona, format, domain instruction, context template, evolution directive, insight pattern, emotional tone, language mixing, error recovery, safety guardrail), fitness-weighted gene selection, feedback-driven evolution (positive → +0.05, negative → −0.08, low-fitness triggers mutation), safety classification decorator with localized refusal responses, and response sanitization to strip LLM artifacts before display. |

## Skill Graph

These skills form a **skill graph** — a network of interconnected markdown files where [[wikilinks]] carry meaning in prose. Instead of 25 isolated documents, you get a traversable knowledge structure where each skill links to the ones it depends on, enables, or complements.

**Entry point:** [`skills/index.md`](skills/index.md) — scan the landscape, then follow links into the areas that matter for your task.

### How the Graph Works

- **YAML frontmatter** on every skill file — scan `title` and `description` without reading the full content
- **Wikilinks in prose** — `[[skill-name]]` links woven into sentences tell the agent *when* and *why* to follow them
- **Maps of Content (MOCs)** — each category README organizes its skills into a navigable sub-topic with cross-category connections
- **Progressive disclosure** — index → MOC descriptions → wikilinks → sections → full content. Most decisions happen before reading a single full file

### Key Clusters

| Cluster | Skills | What Connects Them |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| **Module Foundation** | 01 → 02 → 03 | Tuist modules → catalog composition root → UI composers |
| **Data Flow Triangle** | 12 → 08, 11, 15 | CoreData sync feeds LLM, notifications, and widgets |
| **Monetization Loop** | 07 ↔ 10 → 20 | Trial controls access, analytics tracks funnel, fastlane ships |
| **Testing Pyramid** | 09 → 05, 17, 18 | Mock data feeds unit, snapshot, and UI tests |
| **Build-to-Ship** | 01 → 18 → 22 → 20 | Project gen → Makefile → CI/CD → App Store delivery |
| **Observability** | 26 → 25 → 10 | Structured logging → performance profiling → privacy-first analytics |

## How to Use These Skills

### As AI Agent Context (Skill Graph)

Point your agent at the graph index and let it traverse:

```bash
# Start from the graph entry point — agent follows relevant links
@skills/index.md

# Load a category MOC for focused context
@skills/architecture/README.md

# Load a specific skill with its cross-references
@skills/architecture/01-tuist-modular-architecture.md
```

The agent reads the index, scans frontmatter descriptions, follows wikilinks that matter for the current task, and skips what doesn't. This is the difference between injecting a document and giving the agent a knowledge structure to navigate.

### As Flat Context (Traditional)

Each skill is still **self-contained** — it provides enough context to implement the pattern correctly without reading other skills:

```bash
# Load all architecture skills as flat context
@skills/architecture/

# Load everything
@skills/
```

### As a Developer Reference

Browse the categories above and jump to whichever skill matches your current implementation challenge. The skills are numbered for reference but can be read in any order.

### As a Starting Point for Your Own Skills

Fork this repo and add skills specific to your project's domain. The [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide explains the file naming convention, template structure, and quality checklist.

---

## Skill Structure

Every skill follows the same structure for consistency:

```yaml
---
title: "Skill Title"
description: "1-2 sentence summary scannable without reading the file"
---

# Title

## Context
When and why you need this pattern. What problem does it solve?

## Pattern
The concrete implementation with Swift code.
Broken into layers/steps with ### subheadings.
[[wikilinks]] to related skills woven into prose.

## Edge Cases
Boundary conditions, race conditions, and failure modes.

## Why This Matters
Why this pattern exists and what it prevents.

## Anti-Patterns
Common mistakes and what to avoid.
```

The **YAML frontmatter** lets agents scan descriptions without reading full files. The **Context** helps decide *whether* to apply the skill, the **Pattern** provides *how* with `[[wikilinks]]` pointing to related skills, the **Edge Cases** document boundary conditions and failure modes, and the **Anti-Patterns** prevent common mistakes.
